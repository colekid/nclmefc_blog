### Who Am I?
I was born in the Pearl of the Orient Seas, Philippines. Now, I am currently studying and living in the United States. I am an only child and was strictly supervised by my parents. I was taught to just study and read books. I was an introvert and a wallflower kid. On the other hand, I did aspire a lot of things. I aspired to be a scientist/chemist because I like experimenting and inventing stuff, an engineer because I want to build a house for my parents, and also, I thought of being a badminton athlete because I enjoyed playing it. However, these dreams that I want to achieve changed just because of a certain situation and it was when my parents gave me a PC for my birthday. This made me be curious how people behind the creation of this machinery built something that changed people’s lives. I asked myself, “What would I do to be able to change the way we live?” With this in mind, I finally had a goal to focus on which is to be able to work in the tech industry, to build my own company, and to be someone who can help for the betterment of our society.
